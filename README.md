# GUFI-Lucky
Summer 2019 Research Project
Goal of this project is to develope a mostly automated Lucky Imaging data reduction pipeline
The end project will hopefully only require a small amount of information from the user in oder to locate, gather, and format the files 
that will be used in the data reduction.
